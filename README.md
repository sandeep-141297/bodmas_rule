Here's a **ready-to-use full post** explaining the **BODMAS rule**, common doubts, and **examples (with and without brackets and orders)**. You can use this for social media, teaching, blogs, or notes.

## 📌 **Understand BODMAS Rule with Examples (Full Guide)**

### 🔠 What is BODMAS?

**BODMAS** is a rule used to determine the correct order of operations when solving mathematical expressions.

It stands for:

* **B** = Brackets
* **O** = Orders (powers, roots like square, cube, √, etc.)
* **D** = Division
* **M** = Multiplication
* **A** = Addition
* **S** = Subtraction

---

### ❗Common Doubts:

#### ❓ Q1: Do we do **Division before Multiplication**?

🟢 **No.** Division and multiplication have **equal priority**.
👉 Solve them **left to right** as they appear.

#### ❓ Q2: Do we do **Addition before Subtraction**?

🟢 **No.** Addition and subtraction also have **equal priority**.
👉 Solve them **left to right** as they appear.

## 🔢 Example with B, O, D, M, A, S

## ✅ Example 1: Without Brackets/Orders

**Expression**: `2 - 2 * 2 / 2 + 2`

### 🧮 Step-by-step:

1. **Multiplication**: `2 * 2 = 4`

2. **Division**: `4 / 2 = 2`
   👉 Expression becomes: `2 - 2 + 2`

3. **Subtraction**: `2 - 2 = 0`

4. **Addition**: `0 + 2 = 2`

✅ **Final Answer**: **2**

---

## ✅ Example 2: Let's now include **Brackets (B)** and **Orders (O)** in an example to demonstrate the **full power of BODMAS**.

**Expression**:
`(3 + 2)² ÷ 5 * 2 - 4`

Let’s solve this **step-by-step using BODMAS**:

---

### 🔷 Step 1: **B = Brackets**

`(3 + 2)` = `5`

So now the expression becomes:
`5² ÷ 5 * 2 - 4`

---

### 🔷 Step 2: **O = Orders (Exponents)**

`5²` = `25`

Now the expression is:
`25 ÷ 5 * 2 - 4`

---

### 🔷 Step 3: **D & M = Division and Multiplication (Left to Right)**

Start from the left:

1. `25 ÷ 5 = 5`
2. `5 * 2 = 10`

Now expression becomes:
`10 - 4`

---

### 🔷 Step 4: **A & S = Addition and Subtraction (Left to Right)**

1. `10 - 4 = 6`

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **6**

---

## ❌ Common Mistake Example

> ❌ Doing all division before multiplication
> ❌ Doing all addition before subtraction

❗ **Wrong Method (for `2 - 2 * 2 / 2 + 2`)**:
If you do division before multiplication incorrectly:

* `2 - 2 * (2 / 2)` = `2 - 2 * 1` = `2 - 2 = 0` ❌

This is **incorrect** because you must do **from left to right**.

---

## 🧠 Summary

✅ **BODMAS Rule** =
👉 Brackets → Orders → Division/Multiplication (left to right) → Addition/Subtraction (left to right)

## 🧠 Important Notes:

* We **always solve brackets first**.
* Then we handle **orders (powers/square roots)**.
* Then **division and multiplication left to right**.
* Then **addition and subtraction left to right**.

Use this rule **step-by-step** to solve any math expression correctly!
